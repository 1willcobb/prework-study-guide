# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The prework study guide project was to practice to get me familure with HTML, CSS, and JS and how they interact. 

- With this project and more, I hope to understand full stack development in the future.
- The problem that this project solves is to host some info I learned, but really to get my fingers moving and thoughts flowing. 
- I really learned a ton about git management and github. Those seem very exciting.
